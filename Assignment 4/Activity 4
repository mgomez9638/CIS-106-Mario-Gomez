#Activity 4
#The program consists of calculating the areas of shapes. The user has to implement: the base, vertical height, length of sides, width and radius. It all revolves around a single set of answers.  
b = float(input("Enter the base: "))
h = float(input("Enter the height: "))
a = float(input("Enter the length a side: "))
w = float(input("Enter the width: "))
r = float(input("Enter the radius: "))
area_triangle = (1/2) * b * h
area_square = a * a 
area_rectangle = w * h
area_parallelogram = b * h
area_trapezoid = (1/2)* (a+b)
circumference_circle = 2 * 3.14 * r
print("The area of the triangle is " + str(area_triangle)+ ". The area of a a square is " + str(area_square) + ". The area of rectangle is " + str(area_rectangle) + ". The area of parallelogram is " + str(area_parallelogram) + ". The area of a trapezoid is " + str(area_trapezoid) + ". The circumference of a circle is " + str(circumference_circle) + "." )
