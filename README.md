# CIS-106-Mario-Gomez

## Assignment 1

My name is Mario Gomez. I am taking this course to further my knowledge of programming. The language I have selected to use is Python because I have not programmed in that language yet. I would like to learn more about coding languages, so I selected python. I intend to use this programming language to do the programs. Python is the basic programming language that is fairly popular and should be learned by programmers.

## Assignment 2

The second week of CIS 106 was review to me. The coding is currently simple and interchangable. It reminded me of coding with Swift on Xcode. The source code management helps to keep track of the files, and it is easily accesible. The IDEs that I decided to test on were Xcode, Repl.it, and Thonny. I intend to apply this into my future projects. Github will help me go back to old programs, if I need a refresher. 

## Assignment 3

In session 3 of CIS 106 was figuring out how to code properly with Flowgorithm. The code layout was different between Flowgorithm and the IDEs. There was syntax complications as well as operations were a bit different. I managed to find the solutions between them two. I did them the long way, and I should focus on shortening the amount of lines of code. I will practice on more activities to find faster and more efficient ways to code with Flowgorithm and IDEs.

## Assignment 4

In session 4 of CIS 106, it was learning about the basic operations of coding. It is always a good idea to refresh on similar material. We all forget certain information sometimes. I have seen that there are some restrictions on what you can and cannot do. I intend to apply this in my learning by going back and referring to discussions. I will keep it concise as well as use research material before entering the activity. There is no better way to improve, then through hands-on activities.

## Assignment 5

In session 5 of CIS 106, we go further into coding by learning about functions. It focuses on specifying the task and how functions control how the program runs. It, also, mentions about the program layout. This will help me out when creating programs in the IDE. This emphasizes each part of the program. There is always new things to learn and reasons why. I thought a programmer's main goal was to keep it as small as possible, but it is not. Programming is not a competition of how small someone could make it. The separation between lines and functions is about being able to read the code. It is crucial to emphasize each part if you want to refer back to it. The code layout makes it accesible and easier to maintain when it comes to lengthier programs. When you start to do it with small programs, it becomes a habit with bigger programs.
