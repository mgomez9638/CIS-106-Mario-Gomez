# CIS-106-Mario-Gomez

## Assignment 1

My name is Mario Gomez. I am taking this course to further my knowledge of programming. The language I have selected to use is Python because I have not programmed in that language yet. I would like to learn more about coding languages, so I selected python. I intend to use this programming language to do the programs. Python is the basic programming language that is fairly popular and should be learned by programmers.

## Assignment 2

The second week of CIS 106 was review to me. The coding is currently simple and interchangable. It reminded me of coding with Swift on Xcode. The source code management helps to keep track of the files, and it is easily accesible. The IDEs that I decided to test on were Xcode, Repl.it, and Thonny. I intend to apply this into my future projects. Github will help me go back to old programs, if I need a refresher. 

## Assignment 3

In session 3 of CIS 106 was figuring out how to code properly with Flowgorithm. The code layout was different between Flowgorithm and the IDEs. There was syntax complications as well as operations were a bit different. I managed to find the solutions between them two. I did them the long way, and I should focus on shortening the amount of lines of code. I will practice on more activities to find faster and more efficient ways to code with Flowgorithm and IDEs.

## Assignment 4

In session 4 of CIS 106, it was learning about the basic operations of coding. It is always a good idea to refresh on similar material. We all forget certain information sometimes. I have seen that there are some restrictions on what you can and cannot do. I intend to apply this in my learning by going back and referring to discussions. I will keep it concise as well as use research material before entering the activity. There is no better way to improve, then through hands-on activities.

## Assignment 5

In session 5 of CIS 106, we go further into coding by learning about functions. It focuses on specifying the task and how functions control how the program runs. It, also, mentions about the program layout. This will help me out when creating programs in the IDE. This emphasizes each part of the program. There is always new things to learn and reasons why. I thought a programmer's main goal was to keep it as small as possible, but it is not. Programming is not a competition of how small someone could make it. The separation between lines and functions is about being able to read the code. It is crucial to emphasize each part if you want to refer back to it. The code layout makes it accesible and easier to maintain when it comes to lengthier programs. When you start to do it with small programs, it becomes a habit with bigger programs. 

## Assignment 6

In session 6 of CIS 106, we go back to IDEs to improve on our past programs. We are starting to use functions to separate the code to make it easier to read and more accessible. There may be different ways of formatting and style of code, but it needs to be organized. Functions help us with these issues. We also get to notice some of the changes between using Flowgorithm and IDEs. I believe the main goal is to make it more accessible, therefore, help us if we want to pursue a job in coding. This will also further improve on what is expected of us in both school and at work. 

## Assignment 7

In session 7 of CIS 106, we learn how to use if/else condition statements. It helps the users determine a result with their given information. This is helpful when it comes to creating multiple functions and the user has the choice to pick which function. Furthermore, creating these programs in Flowgorithm becomes a bit of a challenge because there are certain restrictions. My future goal is to find a workaround on other activities. 

## Assignment 8

In session 8 of CIS 106, we learn about loops and how useful they are. More specifically, we focused on while loops. It requires the user to test a condition until it is met. The loop structure is different than the function structure. I am learning the proper way to code rather than just doing it to do it. I want to being involved in some way with coding in my future. 

## Assignment 9

In session 9 of CIS 106, we learn about do while loops and repeat until loops. It helps the user by focusing on executing a block before checking on the condition. I am not as familiar with do while loops as I should be but I have used them before. My go to loop was usually the for loop. I mostly implemented them into my projects until I learned about switch case. I enjoyed to create introduction descriptions, menus afterwards, and then closing descriptions when the user ended the program. Moreover, creating these programs in Flowgorithm is a bit of a head scratcher because it is different than IDEs. Every new documentation has its assets, so I will be learning as I go.
 
## Assignment 10

In session 10 of CIS 106, we go further into loops expanding into for loops and nested loops. We can see the advantages and disadvantages of each loop now in our programs. There are opportunities to use nested loops when you want to give the user more access. It contains a bit more work, but its intended for the outer loop to repeat them action if needed. When looking at programs, I kept thinking about for loops and how helpful they would be in these programs. Now, I am learning how to use them in python. Most programming professions work with python, so it is an asset to learn this language.

## Assignment 11

In session 11 of CIS 106, we begin to learn about arrays. When I think of arrays, I also think about vectors. Vectors are dynamic compared to arrays being fixed. In Python, there are no vectors, but there exists arrays, lists, and tuples. I did not know they had there own category in Python. This function will help when grouping different elements. I could create a list of fruit and display it. It makes displaying the same datatype easier. I would imagine from here on out we would be using arrays in some future programs. 

## Assignment 12

In session 12 of CIS 106, we split into dynamic arrays. I did not acknowledge that there were more than one type of array. Each one has its own functions. These are implemented into many programs when creating notes. This will help me out in future programs when implementing elements of the same type. 

## Assignment 13
