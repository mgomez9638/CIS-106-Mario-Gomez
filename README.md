# CIS-106-Mario-Gomez

My name is Mario Gomez. I am taking this course to further my knowledge of programming. The language I have selected to use is python because I have not programmed in that language yet. I would like to learn more about coding languages, so I selected python. I intend to use this programming language to do the programs. Python is the basic programming language that is fairly popular and should be learned by programmers.
