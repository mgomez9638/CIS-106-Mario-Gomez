# CIS-106-Mario-Gomez

## Assignment 1

My name is Mario Gomez. I am taking this course to further my knowledge of programming. The language I have selected to use is Python because I have not programmed in that language yet. I would like to learn more about coding languages, so I selected python. I intend to use this programming language to do the programs. Python is the basic programming language that is fairly popular and should be learned by programmers.

## Assignment 2

The second week of CIS 106 was review to me. The coding is currently simple and interchangable. It reminded me of coding with Swift on Xcode. The source code management helps to keep track of the files, and it is easily accesible. The IDEs that I decided to test on were Xcode, Repl.it, and Thonny. I intend to apply this into my future projects. Github will help me go back to old programs, if I need a refresher. 

## Assignment 3

In session 3 of CIS 106 was figuring out how to code properly with Flowgorithm. The code layout was different between Flowgorithm and the IDEs. There was syntax complications as well as operations were a bit different. I managed to find the solutions between them two. I did them the long way, and I should focus on shortening the amount of lines of code. I will practice on more activities to find faster and more efficient ways to code with Flowgorithm and IDEs.
